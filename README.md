h# Adroit-Scheduler
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### An intelligent timetable generator that generates University timetable using `Genetic Algorithm`.

 #### Dependencies:
 1. python3.6 or above
 2. Django2.0 or above
 

#### About the project:
The Automated Timetable Scheduler is designed to streamline the process of creating and managing timetables. By leveraging the power of genetic algorithms, the system efficiently generates schedules that accommodate various constraints. Additionally, the project includes machine learning capabilities for course recommendations and resume screening.

The program satisfies the following constraints:- 

| Hard Constraints                                  | Soft Constraints                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------:-------------------------------------------------
| Unique class timing                               | classes are alloted according to section requirements|
| Course.students <= room.seating capacity          | All courses are according to their department        |
| Two classes dont have same room                   | Even distribution of course in a section per week    |
| Class timing for each teacher is unique           |
| Teachers are allocated to their course accordingly|
